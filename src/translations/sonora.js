      aboutportalmain: "Sweden possesses a uniquely rich cultural heritage of well-preserved pipe organs, among them no fewer than 436 instruments, built between ca. 1600 and 1860. This heritage of organs is not only present in the instruments themselves but also in a wealth of documentary materials of different kinds: written documents (such as correspondence, documentation reports, annotations, contracts, etc.), drawings, photos and sound recordings, resulting from many decades of information-gathering by dedicated organ experts. The material is an invaluable asset to research, but most of it is unpublished and has been difficult to access.",
      aboutportalmain2: "The purpose of the project “Swedish ONline ORgan Archive” (acronym: SONORA), is to make available online documentary material regarding Sweden’s many classical pipe organs. The material comes from six Swedish archives and broadly pertains to preserved instruments built before the 1860s. The specific selection criteria follow those set out by Einar Erici in his Orgelinventarium and include instruments where significant parts of the original constructions, such as windchests, have been preserved. Instruments where, for example, only the façade is preserved have not been included.",
      aboutportalmain3: "The project, conducted by the Göteborg International Organ Academy Association (FGIOA), has been funded in its entirety by Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, a leading Swedish foundation for research in the humanities and social sciences. Important collaboration partners include the Swedish National Heritage Board (Riksantikvarieämbetet, RAÄ), with the ATA (Antiquarian-Topographical Archive); and the University of Gothenburg, in particular the Gothenburg University Library and the Gothenburg Research Infrastructure in Digital Humanities (GRIDH).",
