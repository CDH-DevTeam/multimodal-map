      aboutportalmain: "Sweden possesses a uniquely rich cultural heritage of well-preserved pipe organs, among them no fewer than 436 instruments, built between ca. 1600 and 1860. This heritage of organs is not only present in the instruments themselves but also in a wealth of documentary materials of different kinds: written documents (such as correspondence, documentation reports, annotations, contracts, etc.), drawings, photos and sound recordings, resulting from many decades of information-gathering by dedicated organ experts. The material is an invaluable asset to research, but most of it is unpublished and has been difficult to access.",
      aboutportalmain2: "The main purpose of the project “Swedish ONline ORgan Archive” (acronym: SONORA), 2021–2024, is to bring together this immense documentary material on Sweden’s classical organs by digitising and entering it into an open online database, constructed specifically for the purpose, with advanced but user-friendly search functions and linked to new media. The database offers completely new opportunities for research in music and cultural history but will also serve as an attractive source of information for anyone interested in the organ and its history. In addition, the project will enable long-term strategic work for the preservation and maintenance of the historical instruments.",
